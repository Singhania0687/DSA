## ✅ 1. Basics of Singly Linked List

### These cover core operations. Make sure to practice both iterative and recursive approaches where applicable.

- Create a Linked List from an array
- Traverse a Linked List
- Insert at beginning / end / Nth position
- Delete at beginning / end / Nth position
- Find the length of a Linked List (iterative & recursive)
- Search for an element in a Linked List
- Get Nth node (iterative & recursive)

--- 

## 🔁 2. Reversal Problems

### Common in interviews; test understanding of pointers.

- Reverse a Linked List (iterative & recursive)
- Reverse the first K nodes
- Reverse a Linked List in groups of K nodes (very common)
- Reverse alternate K nodes in a Linked List
- Reverse a sublist from position m to n

---

## 🧠 3. Two Pointer Technique (Floyd’s, slow/fast)

### Great for optimization and cycle detection.

- Find middle of Linked List (slow & fast pointer)
- Detect cycle in a Linked List (Floyd’s algorithm)
- Find the starting node of the loop
- Remove loop in a Linked List
- Check if the Linked List is palindrome (using stack / two pointers)
- Find the intersection point of two Linked Lists

---

## 🔀 4. Merge & Sort Operations

### These test understanding of pointer manipulation and divide-and-conquer.

- Merge two sorted Linked Lists (recursive & iterative)
- Merge K sorted Linked Lists (use min-heap/priority queue)
- Sort a Linked List using Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort on a Linked List

---

## 🧱 5. Modification / Transformation

 ### These are medium-to-hard level.

- Remove duplicates from sorted Linked List
- Remove duplicates from unsorted Linked List (use HashSet)
- Remove N-th node from end of list (two pointer)
- Rotate Linked List by K places
- Swap nodes in pairs
- Swap Kth node from beginning and end
- Move last element to front
- Segregate even and odd nodes
- Rearrange nodes in zig-zag fashion

## 🧩 6. Special Types of Linked List

### Though still singly linked, these might include extra pointers or constraints.

- Clone a Linked List with a random pointer (using hash map or constant space method)
- Flatten a multilevel Linked List
- Copy a linked list where each node has a next and an arbitrary/random pointer

---

## 💥 7. Deletion & Duplicate Handling

 ### Good for pointer safety and interview corner cases.
- Delete node with given key
- Delete node at given position
- Delete a node without head pointer
- Delete nodes with greater value on the right
- Delete all occurrences of a key

---

## 📊 8. Counting / Searching Problems

 #### Used for pattern recognition or checking constraints.
- Count occurrences of a given number
- Find the first non-repeating element
- Check if the list is sorted
- Count nodes in a loop

---

## 🔗 9. Advanced Pointer & Recursion Based

  #### Hard-level and often require deep logic.
- Add two numbers represented by linked lists
- Multiply two numbers represented by linked lists
- Intersection of two linked lists
- Flatten a Linked List (with child pointers)
- Reorder Linked List (L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1…)

---

## 🧪 10. Miscellaneous / Tricky Questions

  ### Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
- Convert Linked List to Balanced BST
- Convert Sorted Linked List to BST
- Find triplet from three linked lists with given sum
- Check if Linked List is circular
- Split Linked List into K parts
- Group odd and even nodes

---

### ⚒️ Use Cases in Interviews:

- Memory-constrained environments (like OS, drivers)
- Designing data structures (e.g., LRU Cache uses Doubly Linked List + HashMap)
- Real-time streaming data (Linked List used for queues or logs)
- Custom memory allocators
